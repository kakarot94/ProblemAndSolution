## Problems

- **Add strings** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/AddStrings.java)]
  - Two numbers are given in the form of String. Add those two numbers without transforming String into integer.
- **Add to array** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/AddToArrayForm.java)]
  - Given the array of length n and random number, add those two values. 
    <br>Examle :
    <br>  Array value  = {5, 3, 2}
    <br>  int value    =  2  5  6
    <br>  result value = {7, 8, 8}
- **Add two single linked lists** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/AddTwoNumbers.java)]
  - You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
- **Atoi integer converter** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/AtoiSolution.java)]
  - Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.
- **Busiest server** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/BusiestServer.java)]
  - You have k servers numbered from 0 to k-1 that are being used to handle multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite
  computational capacity but cannot handle more than one request at a time. The requests are assigned to servers according to a specific algorithm:
    - The ith (0-indexed) request arrives.
    - If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).
    - If the (i % k)th server is available, assign the request to that server.
    - Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server
- **Container with most water** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/ContainerWithMostWater.java)]
  - Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such 
  that the two end points of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines,  which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
- **Hammering nails** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/HammeringNails.java)]
  - Depending on the arrangement of a given sequence of numbers and a given number of possible shifts, determine the length of the longest substring that can be obtained with certain shifts.
- **Integer extractor** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/IntegerExtractor.java)]
  - Given a string containing none, one or many numbers, find all numbers in that string. Numbers is non-negative and can be divided by any character.
- **Is given String palindrom** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/LongStringPalindrome.java)]
  - Check if the String is palindrom
- **Longest palindrom** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/LongestPalindrom.java)]
  - Given a String s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.
- **Marging lists** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/MargingLists.java)]
  - Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
- **Madian of two sorted arrays** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/MedianOfTwoSortedArrays.java)]
  - Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
- **Marging K lists** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/MergingKLists.java)]
  - You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order. Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.
- **Palindrome number** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/PalindromeNumber.java)]
  - Given a integer n, find if that integer is palindrome without converting that integer into string.
- **Multiply strigs** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/MultiplyStrings.java)]
  - Given two string representations of numbers, multiply them without converting them into int.
- **Palindrom linked list** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/PalindromeLinkedList.java)]
  - Check whether given linked list is palindrome.
- **Parking system design** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/ParkingSystem.java)]
  - Design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces: big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size.
- **Increment array** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/PlusOne.java)]
  - Given the array that represents number, increment that array by one.
- **Reverse integer** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/ReverseInteger.java)]
  - Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
- **Reverse K nodes in linked list** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/ReverseKNodes.java)]
  - Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.
- **Shortest unsorted continuous array** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/ShortestUnsortedContinuousSubarray.java)]
  - Given the array of numbers, find shortest unsorted continuous array. Remember, one element is sorted, that means result can eather be 0 or greater then 1.
- **Special position** [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/SpecialPosition.java)]
  - Given the two dimensional array, find special position in that array.

# Problem and solution

For each given problem, there is a solution. In this project you can find solutions for some typical problems given in interviews.

## Problems

- ### Add strings [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/AddStrings.java)]
  - Two numbers are given in the form of String. Add those two numbers without transforming String into integer.
- ### Add to array [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/AddToArrayForm.java)]
  - Given the array of length n and random number, add those two values. 
    <br>Examle :
    <br>  Array value  = {5, 3, 2}
    <br>  int value    =  2  5  6
    <br>  result value = {7, 8, 8}
- ### Add two single linked lists [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/AddTwoNumbers.java)]
  - You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
- ### Atoi integer converter [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/AtoiSolution.java)]
  - Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.
- ### Busiest server [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/BusiestServer.java)]
  - You have k servers numbered from 0 to k-1 that are being used to handle multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite
  computational capacity but cannot handle more than one request at a time. The requests are assigned to servers according to a specific algorithm:
    - The ith (0-indexed) request arrives.
    - If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).
    - If the (i % k)th server is available, assign the request to that server.
    - Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server
- ### Container with most water [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/ContainerWithMostWater.java)]
  - Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such 
  that the two end points of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines,  which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
- ### Hammering nails [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/HammeringNails.java)]
  - Depending on the arrangement of a given sequence of numbers and a given number of possible shifts, determine the length of the longest substring that can be obtained with certain shifts.
- ### Integer extractor [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/IntegerExtractor.java)]
  - Given a string containing none, one or many numbers, find all numbers in that string. Numbers is non-negative and can be divided by any character.
- ### Is given String poliandrom [[look me up](https://github.com/kakarot94/ProblemAndSolution/blob/master/src/solutions/LongStringPalindrome.java)]
  - Check if the String is poliandrom
